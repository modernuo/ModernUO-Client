# PoC Log

Running checkpoint log for the modern-client proof of concept. **When resuming after a compaction or handoff, read this file first.**
Branch: `poc/modern-client` (based on `research/modern-client-evaluation`).

## Goals (from the owner, 2026-10-23)

1. Decide the ECS: Friflo vs TinyEcs vs Flecs.NET.
2. Decide the renderer stack.
3. Preliminary data format, converted from `C:\Ultima Online Classic`, that serves the GPU-driven renderer: texture-array pages, instancing, streaming/residency, zoom, HiDPI.
4. Then keep proving out the engine and tech stack.

UltimaLive support is optional if it costs performance. The v0 format supports it at block granularity: replace one block, re-bake one chunk.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `poc/Uo.Pack` | Pack format v0: structs, readers, writers. **The contract.** Spec: `docs/modern-client/pack-format-v0.md` |
| `poc/Uo.Converter` | UO files → packs. Reuses `src/ClassicUO.Assets` (UOFileManager) for UOP/MUL/verdata reading |
| `poc/Uo.Render` | SDL3 + SDL_GPU renderer (D3D12 first; HLSL → DXIL via the Windows SDK's `dxc.exe`) |
| `C:\Repositories\uo-packs\` | Converter output (not committed; large) |
| `C:\Repositories\EcsBench` | ECS benchmark harness (copy in `research/ecs-bench`) |

## Checkpoints

### 2026-10-24 — CP1: format and scaffolding

- Research docs committed on `research/modern-client-evaluation` (29a19c82f).
- Pack format v0 spec plus the `Uo.Pack` library; builds.
- Launched subagents:
  - **Converter:** build `poc/Uo.Converter` and produce packs.
  - **Renderer:** build `poc/Uo.Render`, synthetic data first, then packs.
  - **Flecs.NET adapter** for EcsBench (checksums plus an AOT smoke test only; final timing runs are done by the main session when the machine is quiet).
  - **FNA 26.10 upgrade** in a worktree, branch `chore/fna-26.10` off `main`.

## Next

- Review each agent's output and commit it.
- Run final Flecs.NET timing rounds when no builds are running, then write `docs/modern-client/ecs-decision.md`.
- Integrate the renderer with real packs, measure, write `docs/modern-client/renderer-decision.md`.
